# Code Samples
These code samples are examples of my daily work and change from time to time.
The samples are mostly for use with Data Science and Big Data (Hadoop) releated
ativities. Some of the code (or snippets of code) was produced by others and
then modified by me to adress my needs. Feel free use them for your own projects.
You can find me on LinkedIn or on Google+ if you have any comments/questions.

### TSVToSeq.java
This is a handy utility if you manually extract data from a database and then need to have that data converted to a Hadoop Sequence file for use with Mahout for example.
